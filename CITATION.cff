abstract: >-
  A RESTful API for the APE library (RESTful APE) provides a
  way for users to interact with APE's automated pipeline
  exploration capabilities through HTTP requests. APE is a
  command line tool and Java API that automates the
  exploration of possible computational pipelines from large
  collections of computational tools.


  The RESTful API allows users to submit requests to the APE
  server for pipeline exploration, which returns results in
  a standard format such as JSON or XML. Users can interact
  with APE through a web browser or any other HTTP client,
  and the API can be integrated into other applications for
  seamless pipeline exploration.


  Overall, the RESTful API for APE provides a powerful and
  flexible way for users to leverage APE's capabilities in
  their scientific workflows.
