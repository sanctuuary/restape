## Best Coding Practices for Java and Spring Boot

When contributing code, please ensure it adheres to the following best practices:

- **Follow Java and Spring Boot best practices**: This includes proper use of annotations, configuration management, and exception handling. Utilize Spring's dependency injection to keep your code clean and testable.
- **Code Style**: Adhere to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) to ensure consistency and readability in the codebase.
- **Documentation**: All public methods and classes should be documented with Javadoc comments. This is crucial for maintainability and for other contributors to understand your code.
- **Testing**: Include unit tests for new features and bug fixes. We use JUnit and Spring Boot Test for testing. Aim for high coverage to ensure quality and prevent regressions.
